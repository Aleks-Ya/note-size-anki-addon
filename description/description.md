**"Note Size"** addon displays size of Notes including attachments:

1. In "Size" column in the Browser (sorting is supported)
2. When you are adding a new note (at real time)
3. When you are editing an existing note (at real time)

You can easily identify the largest notes to reduce your collection size.
