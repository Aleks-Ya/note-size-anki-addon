## How note size is calculated

A note size comprises:

1. Size of texts stored in fields.
2. Sizes of files referred from the fields. File size on the disk is used.

**Some symbols can consume more than 1 byte.**  
For example, a space can consume 6 bytes because it can be represented internally as `&nbsp;`.  
Also, Unicode symbols can consume from 1 to 4 bytes each (`A` consumes 1 byte, while `ùõ¥` consumes 4 bytes).  
Often Anki automatically wraps your text with HTML tags which consume additional bytes.

## How collection size is calculated

Collection size is the size of file `collection.anki2` located in the current profile folder.  
Media size is the size of folder `collection.media` located in the current profile folder.
Total size is sum of the collection and media sizes.
